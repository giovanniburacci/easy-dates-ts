# easy-dates-ts

This typescript library was developed as dumb utility to help managing dates in different formats without committing errors.
It is not intended to be a professional tool, rather a style and developing excercise.
Meanwhile, if it proves to be useful for anybody besides me, that means I'm not the only one who felt and came up with this need :)
